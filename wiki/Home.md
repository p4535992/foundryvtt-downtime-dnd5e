Downtime Dnd5e is a module for use with Foundry VTT and the dnd5e system. It creates a tab on the character sheet that allows players and GMs to keep track of... well, anything!

# Where It Came From

As of writing this, I've been developing this module for about a year now. It originally sprang from my group's need to keep track of training skill proficiencies, and after a couple long nights, I had a working prototype of what eventually became this module. Back then all it did was let you roll a skill check and add the number to a progress bar. A year later, thanks to some amazing feedback and clever usage from the wonderful FVTT community, this module has grown in ways I never dreamed of when I first started working on it.

# Where It Is Now

All that feedback has really encouraged me to open up what you can do with the module. Here's just a few things I've seen people do with it:

* Keep track of quest progress
* Track faction reputation
* Keep track of training skill, tool, and weapon proficiencies
* Create countdown timers
* Manage group resources
* Create skill challenges
* And a whole lot more!

Feel free to browse through the wiki to get a better idea of how it all works and what it looks like!

# Thank You!

Thanks for checking this project out. I hope you can find cool new ways to use it in your games, and I really look forward to hearing about them!
